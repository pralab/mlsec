title: "Increasing Confidence in Adversarial Examples Defenses"
bio: "Florian Tram√®r is a visiting researcher at Google Brain and an assistant professor of computer science at ETH Zurich.
His research interests lie in Computer Security, Cryptography and Machine Learning security. In his current work, he studies the worst-case behavior of Deep Learning systems from an adversarial perspective, to understand and mitigate long-term threats to the safety and privacy of users."
abstract: "Building a defense against adversarial examples is easy. 
Building one that works is the hard part!
And thus there are countless defenses proposed that ultimately fail to hold up their claims.
In this talk, I'll discuss some recent research that aims to help vet our confidence in a newly proposed defense, to quickly uncover highly dubious robustness claims and evaluation flaws."
