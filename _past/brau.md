title: "Online Certifiable Robustness for Adversarial Perturbation"
bio: "Fabio Brau is a Ph.D. student at the Department of Excellence in Robotics and AI at the Scuola Superiore SantAnna of Pisa, where he works in the ReTiS Laboratory. He obtained his Master's degree in Mathematics from the University of Pisa, where he specialized in Numerical Analysis. Currently, he is studying the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial examples, both from a practical and a theoretical perspective, leveraging geometrical results on the properties of classification models' decision boundaries."
abstract: "The discovery of adversarial examples has led the scientific community to explore various research directions. Verification methods, which involve calculating the distance of a sample from the decision boundary, require significant effort and computational resources. Another approach is to develop robust models, which are less sensitive to adversarial perturbations. Recently, this has been —partially— achieved by using orthogonal layers to create Lipschitz-bounded neural networks. In this seminar, we will cover these topics by presenting a fast method for approximating the boundary distance, as well as a \"signed distance classifier\" model that directly outputs the distance from the boundary instead of a probability score, thus providing a one-shot verification by design."
