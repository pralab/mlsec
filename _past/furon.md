title: "My personal tour of Machine Learning Security"
bio: "Teddy Furon (Ph.D. Telecom ParisTech (2002), Habilitation (2018), IEEE Senior Member) is Directeur de Recherche at Inria centre at Rennes University, France.
His research interests include the security related to multimedia, signal processing, and more recently machine learning.
He has worked in industry (Thomson, Technicolor) and academia. He co-founded the company Imatag protecting rights of photo agencies.
He has been an Associate Editor for four journals, including IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security.
He has been named the French AID chair in Security of Artificial Intelligence."
abstract: "Adversarial examples is the tip of the \"machine learning security‚Äù iceberg because its literature is impressively large.
The first part of the talk briefly presents our humble contributions on white box, black box, and transferable attacks. 
Yet, there are many more threats putting machine learning algorithms into danger.
The second part mentions some of these scenarios like membership inference attack, fingerprinting, and watermarking of DNN.
This leaves the impression that ML security is about studying attacks and defenses for an endless list of scenarios.  
The conclusion of the talk tries to give a more concise definition of what machine learning security is."
