title: "On Robust Conformal Prediction"
bio: "Soroush is a research assistant (PhD candidate) focusing on Trustworthy AI — robustness and uncertainty quantification. He works at CISPA Helmholtz Center for information security, as a PhD researcher. Previously he worked as intern at Apple (machine translation team)."
abstract: "The softmax outputs are not a trustworthy indicator of uncertainty; models return many confident but wrong predictions. Conformal prediction offers prediction sets with coverage guarantee. Despite its versatility, it is fragile under adversarial and natural noises. We develop a progression of techniques that bridge this robustness gap while preserving efficiency and practicality."
