title: "Efficient Malware Analysis Using Metric Embeddings"
bio: "Dr. Scott Coull is the Head of Data Science Research at Google Cloud Security, where he leads a team of talented data scientists in applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to solve complex computer and network security problems. Over the course of his 20-year career, his research interests have spanned a range of topics, including malware classification, censorship circumvention, network traffic analysis, data privacy, and applied cryptography. Most recently, he and his team have begun exploring ways to more tightly couple cybersecurity subject matter expertise with machine learning technologies through the application of weakly supervised learning and large language models. Dr. Coull received his PhD in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University and completed a NSF/CRA Computing Innovation Fellowship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

abstract: "When most researchers think of machine learning applied to malware analysis their minds usually turn toward malware detection. However, real-world malware analysis consists of a complex pipeline of classifiers and data analysis â€“ from dataset sampling techniques to classification of capabilities to retrieval of new training samples from user systems. In this talk, we explore the possibility of streamlining this malware analysis pipeline and reducing tech debt through a single, efficient malware embedding that can be leveraged for multiple downstream tasks. Our evaluation on multiple malware classification datasets, consisting of millions of binaries, shows that our efficient embeddings are capable of successfully transferring to tasks across the entire analysis pipeline. Despite this success, the performance on some tasks lags behind that of purpose-built models, indicating an interesting trade-off between maintenance cost and performance."
