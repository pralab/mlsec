title: "Practical Adversarial ML "
bio: "ML engineer with computational physics background, 20 years in software development"
abstract: "Most of black box adversarial attacks in computer vision are developed and tested on small datasests without being applied to real world cases when target model is unknown but result of attack should be clearly measured. In this talk the successful cases of applying black box attacks against captcha-solving bots that were confirmed by activity monitoring will be presented."
