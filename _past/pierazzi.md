title: "Trends and Challenges in ML-based Malware Detection"
bio: "Dr Fabio Pierazzi is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Cybersecurity at the Department of Informatics of King's College London, where he is also a member of the Cybersecurity (CYS) group and affiliated with UCL's Systems Security Research Lab (S2Lab). His research interests are at the intersection of systems security and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on settings in which attackers adapt quickly to new defenses (i.e., high non-stationarity, adaptive attackers). Previously, he obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Modena, Italy (2014–2017), he visited University of Maryland, College Park, USA (2016), and he was a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at Royal Holloway, University of London (2017–2019).

abstract: "Machine Learning (ML) has become a standard tool for malware research in the academic security community: it has been used in a wide range of domains including Windows, PDF and Android malware, but also of malicious JavaScript and URLs. In this seminar, I will present an overview of the most successful approaches for Android malware detection, focusing on intuitions on how program analysis techniques can be useful in this context. Then, I will discuss the main challenges to overcome for widespread of ML-based  approaches in industry contexts, especially with respect to concept drift, and adversarial robustness to smart adversaries in the problem-space."
