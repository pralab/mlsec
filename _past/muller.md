title: "Realistic Neural Networks with Guarantees"
bio: "Mark Niklas Müller is a Ph.D. student at the Secure, Reliable, and Intelligent Systems Lab at ETH Zurich and advised by Prof. Martin Vechev. Mark’s research focuses on provable guarantees for machine learning models, including both certified training methods as well as deterministic and probabilistic certification methods for a diverse range of neural architectures."
abstract: "Following the discovery of adversarial examples, provable robustness guarantees for neural networks have received increasing attention from the research community. 
While relatively small or heavily regularized models with limited standard accuracy can now be efficiently analyzed, obtaining guarantees for more accurate models remains an open problem. Recently, a new verification paradigm has emerged that tackles this challenge by combining a Branch-and-Bound approach with precise multi-neuron constraints. The resulting, more precise verifiers have in turn enabled novel certified training methods which reduce (over-)regularization to obtain more precise yet certifiable networks. In this talk, we discuss these certification and training methods."
