title: "Learning From Data is about Handling Risk"
bio: "Luca Oneto was born in Rapallo, Italy in 1986. He received his BSc and MSc in Electronic Engineering at the University of Genoa, Italy respectively in 2008 and 2010. In 2014 he received his Ph.D. from the same university in the School of Sciences and Technologies for Knowledge and Information Retrieval with the thesis \"Learning Based On Empirical Data\". In 2017 he obtained the Italian National Scientific Qualification for the role of Associate Professor in Computer Engineering and in 2018 he obtained the one in Computer Science. He worked as Assistant Professor in Computer Engineering at the University of Genoa from 2016 to 2019. In 2018 he was co-founder of the spin-off ZenaByte s.r.l. In 2019 he obtained the Italian National Scientific Qualification for the role of Full Professor in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. In 2019 he became Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Pisa and currently is Associate Professor in Computer Engineering at the University of Genoa. He has been involved in several H2020 projects (S2RJU, ICT, DS) and he has been awarded the Amazon AWS Machine Learning and Somalvico (best Italian young AI researcher) Awards. His first main topic of research is the Statistical Learning Theory with a particular focus on the theoretical aspects of the problems of (Semi) Supervised Model Selection and Error Estimation. His second main topic of research is Data Science with particular reference to the problem of Trustworthy AI and the solution of real-world problems by exploiting and improving the most recent Learning Algorithms and Theoretical Results in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Mining."
abstract: "This talk focuses on creating a simple map of some fundamental concepts behind the problem of Learning From Data. This map should help practitioners and researchers understand and distill the basic ideas behind some of the current theoretical and practical works coming from the Machine Learning field. I will start from the concept of inference describing the fundamental difference between the three possible inference approaches and their relations with the problem of learning from data. Then I will introduce the notion of risk associated with this problem and describe the risk sources showing how to handle them both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. Finally, I will show the connections of these ideas with the Machine Learning Security field and some other recent and hot topics in Learning From Data."
