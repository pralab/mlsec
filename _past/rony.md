title: "Towards a general framework for white-box adversarial attacks"
bio: "Jérôme Rony received his M.A.Sc. in Systems Engineering in 2019 from École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS) Montréal, Canada. He is currently a Ph.D. candidate at ÉTS Montréal. His current research interests include computer vision, adversarial examples, and optimization methods applied to deep learning."
abstract: "Adversarial attack algorithms are dominated by penalty methods, which are slow in practice, and more efficient distance-customized methods, which are heavily tailored to the properties of the distance considered. In this talk, we present the optimization problems related to adversarial examples generation with their specificities, and a white-box attack algorithm to generate minimally perturbed adversarial examples based on Augmented Lagrangian principles, which enjoys the generality of penalty methods and the computational efficiency of distance-customized algorithms."
