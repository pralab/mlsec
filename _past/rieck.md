title: "Adversarial Preprocessing: Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning"
bio: "Konrad Rieck is a professor at TU Braunschweig and leads the Institute of System Security. Previously, he worked at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, TU Berlin and Fraunhofer FIRST. His research focus is the intersection of machine learning and computer security. With his group, he develops intelligent methods for detecting attacks, analyzing malicious code and discovering security vulnerabilities. He received the CAST/GI Doctoral Award, a Google Faculty Research Award and recently an ERC Consolidator Grant."
abstract: "The success of machine learning has been overshadowed by different attacks that thwart its correct operation. While prior work has mainly focused on attacking learning algorithms, another weak spot in learning-based systems has been overlooked: data preprocessing. In this talk, I discuss a recent class of attacks against image scaling. These attacks are agnostic to learning algorithms and affect the preprocessing of all vision systems that use vulnerable scaling implementations, such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Pillow. Based on a root-cause analysis of the vulnerabilities, I present novel defenses that effectively block image-scaling attacks in practice and can be easily added to existing systems.
