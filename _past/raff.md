title: "Why I Hate Parsers and You Should Too"
bio: "Dr. Edward Raff is a Chief Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton, Visiting professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and previous chair of the Conference on Applied Machine Learning and Information Systems. His research covers broad areas of basic and applied machine learning including reproducibility, adversarial attacks/defense, high performance computing, and all of these aspects merge at the intersection of machine learning for malware detection/analysis. Dr. Raff’s work has won five best paper awards, working at the intersection of academia, government, and industry."
abstract: "Cyber security at large, especially malware analysis, often spans multiple file formats and technical details. Extraordinary effort by the research community in dynamic analysis, sandboxing, kernel hooks, and other technologies delve deep into parsing all these formats to obtain the most accurate system possible. However, the research community often fails to neglect the runtime constraints of real-world solutions. This talk will go over why absconding parsing is good for AI research, better for practical cyber security, and how we’ve pushed forward in this direction."
